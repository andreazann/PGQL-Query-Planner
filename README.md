# PGQL-Query-Planner

### PLEASE CHECK OUT THE REPORT IN THE REPOSITORY

For now the planner is able to compute statistics on graphs. This operation is fast and precise (please refer to the Report in the repository). The planning part itself is still in development.

Run from an IDE to perform some test on the precision and speed.

## DATASKETCHES

Statistics are computed through the use of Yahoo! DataSketches library. In the report we explained how this library is used to obtain fast and precise results, and how this planner could be used in real time database systems.
